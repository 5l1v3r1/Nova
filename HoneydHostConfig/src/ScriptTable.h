//Essentially a listing of scripts we currently offer and the types of operating systems they make sense for.
// ****** More of an advanced feature to be implemented when we have more than 5 scripts, for now just set the ports to 'open'
/* We can then iterate over this table (populating only for the OS's we care about from persistent storage or something)
 * and randomly fuzz outside the bounds of what is seen on the network and also more accuractly mimic what we do see
 * with appropriate scripts versus just an open port
