	The Mothership does not install with the standard Nova ./configure, make,
make install process. Instead, the user must change directory into the Nova directory
(most commonly located in the /home/$USER/Code/ directory) and run make install-
mothership with superuser permissions. This will place the Mothership files within the
proper directories and allow for the user to use the alias 'mothership' on the command
line to start the forever process for Mothership. To access the Mothership interface, 
the user must first have configured Nova such that it has the MASTER_UI_ENABLED 
configuration variable set to 1, as well as properly configuring the MASTER_UI_IP
and MASTER_UI_CLIENT_ID variables to match the location and naming requirements for
the user's network.
