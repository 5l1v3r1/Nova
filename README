===============================
What is Nova?
===============================

    Nova is a software application for preventing and detecting hostile Network Reconnaissance. It does this by first creating a large array of thin virtual machines on the target network. These VMs are created using an updated Honeyd to be extremely lightweight. They're not your typical VMs that you might see from VirtualBox or VMWare. They just appear to be real from the perspective of the network, and run network "services" which are just shell scripts.

    Second, Nova uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify attempts at hostile reconnaissance, so there's no need to go searching manually through your honeypot's log files.

===============================
The Installation Guide
===============================

- The first thing to note is that Nova is currently only compatible with
Linux, so if you do not have a Linux machine or a Linux partition on another
machine, I would suggest that you go download Ubuntu 10.04 or higher and install
it, either as a partition or for the whole machine. This guide will not address
any issues with installing Linux; it is concerned with the installation and
proper setup of Nova.


===============================
Getting Dependencies
===============================

- Once you have Ubuntu up and running, you must now download the libraries
required to compile Nova correctly. Make sure to watch the terminals at the
beginning of the install process, and be sure to type 'Y' when asked to do so.
Install the libraries with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libann-dev libpcap0.8-dev build-essential g++ git libqt4-dev libsparsehash-dev libghc6-zlib-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcap2-bin libboost-serialization-dev libnotify-dev mysql-server libcurl3 libcurl4-gnutls-dev


- Now, we'll have to take a quick detour to get another integral component
of Nova: honeyd. We will have to download some extra libraries for honeyd as
well; you can get them using this command:

    sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libdumbnet-dev libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev libedit-dev bison flex libtool automake 


- If you're running Ubuntu 11.10 or higher, you will also need the library
libevent1-dev; procure this by:
    
    sudo apt-get install libevent1-dev


===============================
Getting the newest code
===============================

- Assuming everything has gone well thus far, it's about time to get the
actual code on the machine! First, go to your home directory ('cd ~/' or 'cd
$HOME') and use the mkdir command to create a directory called Code, then cd
into it:

    mkdir Code
    cd Code
 
- Once we're in the code directory, we're going to pull the code for
honeyd and Nova off of the DataSoft Github account and place it into the Code
directory. Type pwd to make sure that you are in the Code directory; if you are,
use the following commands to procure the code:

    git clone git://github.com/DataSoft/Honeyd.git
    git clone git://github.com/DataSoft/Nova.git

- Make sure for these steps that, when asked in the terminal or by pop-up
to produce your private key password and to allow the github server, you reply
yes.


===============================
Building Honeyd
===============================

- Your $HOME/Code/ directory should now have a Honeyd/ folder and a Nova/
folder. Let's go into Honeyd and get that set up before we attempt to compile
Nova. Use the cd command to enter Honeyd/honeyd/:

    cd Honeyd/honeyd

...where all of the honeyd source code should be on your machine. When inside
the source directory, follow the next steps in sequence:

    Step 1: ./autogen.sh
    Step 2: automake
    Step 3: ./configure
    Step 4: make
    Step 5: make sudo make install


===============================
Building Nova
===============================

- Now, onto Nova. Go back to the folder where Nova resides, eg.

    cd ~/Code/Nova

- It should contain directories for each of the modules the program will
use, and if you see a file called Makefile then you're in the right place.

- Now, to generate all the files that will be needed for install, use the
command:

    Step 1: make
    Step 2: sudo make install

- Note: If either of these steps error out, it is suggested that you run
the cleaning command before trying to run them again (i.e. if make errors
out, use sudo make clean to clean Nova's files up before running sudo
make all again. For sudo make install use the command sudo make uninstall.]

- Finally, while logged in as the user you plan to run Novad with, 
run the following command to add your user to the 'nova' permission group
and to set up database permissions for the web interface.

    Step 3: sudo bash InitializeNova.sh

- Your user will have to be in the "nova" group in order for nova and honeyd to
run properly. The InitializeNova.sh script will do this, but you must log in and
back out for the change to take effect.

    Step 4: Log out and log back in

- After these steps are completed without errors, Nova is set up on your
system. You can use the command 'novagui' To start the QT GUI.

Refer to the Help tab in the GUI and the Nova wiki for more information.

===============================
 Web Interface
===============================
NOVA has a web interface that can be used for a GUI instead of the QT novagui.

There is a getDependencies.sh script provided to download the required dependencies.

To install,
    Step 1: cd ~/Code/Nova/NovaWeb
    Step 2: sudo bash getDependencies.sh
    Step 3: sudo npm install -g forever
    Step 1: cd ~/Code/Nova
    Step 4: make web
    Step 5: sudo make install-web

Note that the internal web interface uses SSL. If you want to generate or use your own
SSL certificate and private key, put them in /usr/share/nova/NovaWeb/servercert.pem and
/usr/share/nova/NovaWeb/serverkey.pem after installation.
